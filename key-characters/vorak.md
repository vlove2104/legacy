# Vorak

Malov's twin brother. While his twin brother chose to honour Reinhart by following the remaining Reinhart family in exile, Vorak chose to remain in the capital and work to restore Reinhart's name.

He takes in Lenifer and sets him up as a merchant and orchestrates behind the political scene in Keon to restore Reinhart's name. At one point he realizes that he had a better chance at his goal with the opposing kingdom and changes his plan to bring down the current family.
