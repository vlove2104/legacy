# Malov

Vorak's twin brother. While Vorak stayed in the capital to restore the glory of the Reinhart name, Malov chose to honour Reinhart by following the remaining family into exile.

As the outward-facing twin, he was able to have a family and so has a daughter and a granddaughter, who followed in his footsteps in upholding the family's legacy of protecting the Reinhart family.

## thing wanted

Ensure his descendants follow his way of upholding the family legacy in protecting the Reinharts.
