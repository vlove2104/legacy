Lichte is ready to become an official knight and continue her family's tradition to protect the Reinhart family, but a small part of her longed to leave everything behind and join her estranged father on his ship to explore the continent.

When she learns that her father was arrested and brought to the capital for piracy, she defies her family and leaves to rescue her father. Along the way, she befriends a privateer and discovers the wild side of her charge, the young Reinhart heir, who secretly followed her on her quest.

Lichte arrives at the capital, but before she can rescue her father, she is caught into the conflict between the brutal but collasping monarchy and the revolution struggling to overthrow it. Her hidden connection to the revolution has her questioning her idea of honour and duty to those she care for.
